### How to get BTM ?
Bitmillion - a 'faster' version of Litecoin which also uses scrypt
as a proof of work scheme and is intended for microtransactions.
 - 64 seconds block targets:  ;)
 - 100 000 000 total coins
 - 75 coins per generated block at block 10k
 - difficulty increases every 3 days
 - masternod reward system

So, in fact, this "new" currency exists for the following reasons.
- BTM proves that a Crypto community is open to all and our initiative to create an online currency in Litecoin / Bitcoin shows that it believes in blockchain technology and code security.
- The BTM focused on simple people and local commerce in Brazil and open to everyone.
- Its system of microtransnations comes to bring agility to the network of local payments as it happens with credit card.
- Our idea is to make a crypto and anonymous system that is easy to use and secure at the same time so that every community benefits from this system.
(see the modifications that I applied to the original Litecoin source,
for a generation of genesis blocks, see main.cpp)

Development process
===================
the merit belongs to the whole team!!!

This system was designed from many parts of free code systems based on litecoin> dogecoin> small change and others to find a quick and safe solution, the code was born with the intention of creating a decentralized platform for use in shopping applications that could favor society especially ordinary people, external to the bitcoin community.
The whole team is dedicated to doing the best possible every day correcting bugs and supporting our friends so to speak. our entire community of cryptomoedas
