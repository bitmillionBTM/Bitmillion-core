### How to get BTM ?
Bitmillion - a 'faster' version of Litecoin which also uses scrypt
as a proof of work scheme and is intended for microtransactions.
 - 64 seconds block targets:  ;)
 - 100 000 000 total coins
 - 75 coins per generated block at block 10k
 - difficulty increases every 3 days
 - masternod reward system


So, in fact, this "new" currency exists for the following reasons:
- BTM proves that the Crypto community is open to all and our initiative to create a currency based on Litecoin / Bitcoin shows that we believe in blockchain technology.
(just see the changes I applied to the original Litecoin source,
for the generation of blocks of genesis, see main.cpp)

Development process
===================
the merit belongs to the whole team!!!
This system was designed from many parts of free code systems based on litecoin> dogecoin> small change and others to find a quick and safe solution, the code was born with the intention of creating a decentralized platform for use in shopping applications that could favor society especially ordinary people, external to the bitcoin community.
The whole team is dedicated to doing the best possible every day correcting bugs and supporting our friends so to speak. our entire community of cryptomoedas
